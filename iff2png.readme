  Author:       amigazen project
  Type:         gfx/conv
  Version:      1.4
  Architecture: m68k-amigaos >= 3.1
  Distribution: Aminet
  Kurz:         Konvertiert IFF-Bilder ins PNG-Format

  iff2png is a command-line tool for converting IFF (Interchange File Format)
  bitmap images to PNG format. It supports all major IFF image formats
  including ILBM, PBM, RGBN, RGB8, DEEP, ACBM, YUVN, 24-bit ILBM, and FAXX.

  Features:
  - Supports all major IFF formats (ILBM, PBM, RGBN, RGB8, DEEP, YUVN, ACBM, FAXX)
  - Handles 24-bit ILBM (deep ILBM with true-color RGB)
  - Automatic optimal PNG encoding based on source image properties
  - Preserves transparency and alpha channels
  - Supports HAM (Hold And Modify) and EHB (Extra Half-Brite) modes
  - Preserves metadata (copyright, author, annotations) unless stripped

  Version History
  - 1.4: Added YUVN, fixed major issues in DEEP support, optimised bitplane extraction algorithms
  - 1.3: First public release on Aminet

  Requirements:
  - AmigaOS 3.1 or higher
  - 68020 CPU (but source is available to build other targets)

  Usage:
    iff2png SOURCE TARGET [OPTIONS]

  Arguments:
    SOURCE - Input IFF image file (required)
    TARGET - Output PNG file (required)

  Options:
    FORCE - Overwrite existing output file without prompting
    QUIET - Suppress normal output messages
    OPAQUE - Keep color 0 opaque instead of transparent
    STRIP or NOMETADATA - Remove metadata from output PNG

  Examples:
    iff2png source.iff target.png
    iff2png source.iff target.png FORCE QUIET
    iff2png source.iff target.png OPAQUE

    N.B. file extension is not used to recognize file types

  Supported IFF Formats:
  - ILBM (InterLeaved BitMap) - Standard Amiga bitmap with bitplanes
  - PBM (Packed BitMap) - Packed pixel format
  - RGBN - RGB with N planes (true-color)
  - RGB8 - RGB 8-bit format (24-bit color, 32-bit with alpha)
  - DEEP - High bit-depth format for professional graphics
  - ACBM (Amiga Continuous BitMap) - Format with separate alpha channel
  - YUVN - for YUV-pictures which were mainly used in broadcast television
  - 24-bit ILBM - Deep ILBM with 24 bitplanes for true-color RGB
  - FAXX - Facsimile image format using ITU-T T.4 compression

  The tool automatically selects the optimal PNG encoding based on the source
  image properties, including color type, bit depth, palette optimization,
  and transparency handling.
